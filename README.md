# PHOC_PyLaia
Modified version of PyLaia to include the output of PHOC vectors during training, together with the experiments to run the model in IAM-6, IAM-18 and POPP corpora.

This repository was made public to make the work presented in "Improving Named Entity Recognition in Handwritten Documents by Predicting Pyramidal Histograms of Characters" replicable.
