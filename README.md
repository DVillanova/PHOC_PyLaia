# PHOC_PyLaia
Modified version of PyLaia to include the output of PHOC vectors during training, together with the experiments to run the model in IAM-6, IAM-18 and POPP corpora.

This repository was made public to make the work presented in "Improving Named Entity Recognition in Handwritten Documents by Predicting Pyramidal Histograms of Characters" replicable.

The links to the data are:

**POPP**
GitHub: https://github.com/Shulk97/POPP-datasets/tree/master
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/6581158

**IAM**
Line-level annotations: https://zenodo.org/records/7805128
Extracted from the work of Oliver TÃ¼selmann "Are end-to-end systems really necessary for ner on handwritten document images?"

The images can be downloaded from the FKI group page: https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database
